# GodotSimpleCDAuth
A Simple And Minimalstic Game Activation method that uses HTTPRequest to activate your game, very bare bones.

### How it works
Makes the game pull a list of keys from a website and checks if the key that has been entered by the user matches one of the keys that has been downloaded

It's a very simple way for smaller indie developers who want to beta test their game with a small audiance and is great for people who want to add something similar to their game and want a poke in the right direction

### Warnings about using my way of doing this
Because of how bare bones it is it's unsecure and has it's own small problems, it shouldn't be used on commercial products unless you take some time to find these problems and fix them and make a more secure way of pulling and sending data from your own website and not a public gist from Github

So In general, Use this as a learning template and not as a final system for your game.
